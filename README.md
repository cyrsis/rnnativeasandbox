Init for now

### Library I can use today
NativeBase, Support theme for single file editing rather than hundred of editing

mobX , Kind of like redux , 
- Just make observer and observable


RxJS helps you react to events

MobX will help you react to values (the state).
Specially in sync with Firebase
