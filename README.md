### Library I can use today
NativeBase, Support theme for single file editing rather than hundred of editing

mobX , Kind of like redux , 
- Just make observer and observable

npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy

In the ,baberlrc add ,

"plugins": ["transform-decorators-legacy"]
