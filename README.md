# rnnativeasandbox

Init for now

### Library I can use today
NativeBase, Support theme for single file editing rather than hundred of editing

mobX , Kind of like redux , 
- Just make observer and observable


RxJS helps you react to events

MobX will help you react to values (the state).
Specially in sync with Firebase 

## React native on Windows 
Chococlatey can solve more of the dependency problems

choco install nodejs.install
choco install python2

npm install -g- react-native-cli
